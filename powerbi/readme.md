# Power BI Dashboards

<strong><em>[NEED TO UPDATE ALL PICTURES]</strong></em>

The OEA Chronic Absenteeism Package includes example Power BI dashboards. The aim of these dashboards is to:
  - give a district [overview of hybrid engagement status](#overview-of-hybrid-engagement), and
  - identify a demographic breakdown of [school-level student hybrid engagement](#school-level-hybrid-engagement).

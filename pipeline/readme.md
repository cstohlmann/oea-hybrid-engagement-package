# Package Pipeline

This standard schema uses a Synapse pipeline to:
1. Aggregate and enrich data student SIS data into a single table, from Stage 2p and 2np to Stage 3p and 3np; this will be contained in the data lake as 
 - stage3p/hybrid_engagement/Student_pseduo, and 
 - stage3np/hybrid_engagement/Student_lookup.
2. Create a SQL database to query Stage 3 data via Power BI: sqls3_hybrid_engagement.

<strong><em>Notes:</strong></em>
 - This pipeline can be used for either production or test data (whichever is contained within the data lake when the pipeline is triggered).
 
## Pipeline Setup Instructions
1. Complete the first steps of the [package setup instructions](https://github.com/cstohlmann/oea-hybrid-engagement-package#package-setup-instructions). 
 - You should have triggered the pipeline for the following modules: Contoso SIS, Microsoft Education Insights, Clever, and i-Ready. 
 - You should have also triggered the pipeline for the OEA Digital Engagement Schema Standardization.
2. Download the [package pipeline template](https://github.com/cstohlmann/oea-hybrid-engagement-package/blob/main/pipeline/hybrid_engagement_main_pipeline.zip) locally to your computer.
3. Import the pipeline template to your Synapse workspace.

4. Assign the Synapse linked service needed to support the pipeline template.

5. Change the storageAccount parameter to match the storage account of your Synapse workspace.

6. Navigate to the [HybridEngagement_enrichment notebook](https://github.com/cstohlmann/oea-hybrid-engagement-package/blob/main/notebook/HybridEngagement_enrichment.ipynb). Review the modules and tables used for data aggregation and enrichment; edit the notebook as needed to process the student SIS data into a single table. 
 - <strong><em>Note:</em> If you are using this template for test data, there will be no editing necessary. </strong>

7. Commit/Publish any changes made to the pipeline and notebook. Trigger the pipeline and check that the package SQL db was created (sqls3_hybrid_engagement). Once successful, you're ready to open, connect, and interact with the [package Power BI dashboard](https://github.com/cstohlmann/oea-hybrid-engagement-package/tree/main/powerbi).
